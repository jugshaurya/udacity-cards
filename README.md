# Udacity Cards Project: Mobile Flashcards

_Final Project For React Nanodegree_

```
It allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
```

### Requirements

Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
The front of the card should display the question.
The back of the card should display the answer.
Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
